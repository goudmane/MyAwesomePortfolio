Hello! My name is Oualid, and I love creating things that live on the Internet. My interest in web development began in 2015 when I decided to try editing custom themes and creating console applications.

Fast forward to today, and I have had the privilege of working at a [digital solutions agency](https://www.digitalab.ma/), as a freelancer, and after some time, I secured a position at an [online learning solutions agency](https://soman.ma). During this period, thanks to the senior engineer there, I learned a lot.

In the meantime, I found a better position as a freelancer at [PubMinute](https://pubminute.com/) until today. Most of my career, I have worked full-time and freelanced at the same time.

I also took a mission at a [start-up](https://allyouneed-rh.fr/) as a Full Stack Developer to build a web application for a BnB. Up to my last mission at [MDC](https://www.maisonducaftan.com/), where I coded the UI as a Shopify developer.

My main goal these days is to create accessible and inclusive digital products and experiences for a variety of clients.

Here are some technologies I have worked with recently:
