title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Oualid, and I’m passionate about building robust web applications that make an impact. My journey began with a deep interest in <span class="keyword">web development</span>, where I initially experimented with editing custom themes and creating console applications. Over the years, I've grown into a seasoned <span class="keyword">Full Stack Developer</span> with expertise in <span class="laravel keyword">Laravel</span> and <span class="nuxt keyword">Nuxt</span>.

Since 2015, I’ve had the privilege of working across various industries and teams, from my role at [Digitalab](https://www.digitalab.ma/), where I honed my skills in PHP and front-end development, to working on immersive e-learning solutions at [Soman](https://soman.ma). My experience expanded through freelance projects, including long-term work with [PubMinute](https://pubminute.com/) and various projects as a freelancer.

In recent years, I expanded my skill set at [WebPick](https://webpick.info/), where I gained experience in <span class="keyword">WordPress</span>, <span class="keyword">SEO</span>, and tools like Docker, Git, and Linux. Following that, I developed <span class="keyword">StampBox</span> at [Soorcin](https://soorcin.com/), a dynamic application using the Getaround API, leveraging Laravel's queue system and Sail for VPS setup. Most recently, at [AUCENI](https://auceni.fr/), I helped build <span class="keyword">Network Associate</span> with a small team. This project, developed with <span class="laravel keyword">Laravel</span>, <span class="nuxt keyword">Vue.js</span>, and Docker, involved meticulous database migrations, responsive UI design, and optimized interactions using Eloquent ORM.

Today, my goal is to continue crafting scalable and innovative digital products that serve a diverse range of clients, while constantly evolving with the latest tech trends in web development.
